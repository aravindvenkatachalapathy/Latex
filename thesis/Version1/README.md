## 🏗️ Building

Be sure to have all the dependencies installed (at least the LaTeX build tools), and run
```sh
latexmk thesis
```
in the root directory of the repository to build the thesis.

> [!TIP]
> If you prefer to use 🍃 `Overleaf`, you can find the `TeXtured` template

> there as well.


## 📦 Software Dependencies

LaTeX build tools:
- `latexmk` - LaTeX build tool
- `pdflatex`/`lualatex` - LaTeX engine (you can choose one in `.latexmkrc`)
- `biber` - bibliography processing tool for `biblatex`


> [!NOTE]
> Some scripts assume `linux` environment. These include:
> - generation of directory structure for `aux_dir` (dependencies are `sed`, `xargs`)
> - vector figure generation (together with watermark)
>     + need to enable `--shell-escape` in `.latexmkrc`
>     + `inkscape` - vector graphics (and SVG to PDF conversion)
>     + `perl` - disabling `/Interpolation` in PDFs generated by `inkscape`
>     + `sed` - substituting placeholders in PDF watermark
>     + `ghostscript` - injecting `postscript` watermark into PDF

Version control (optional):
- `git` - (obviously) the preferred version control system
- `git-lfs` - [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) - for storing PDFs, figures, etc.
