abstract = {Abstract The behaviour of spectra and cospectra of turbulence in the surface layer is described within the framework of similarity theory using wind and temperature fluctuation data obtained in the 1968 AFCRL Kansas experiments. With appropriate normalization, the spectra and cospectra are each reduced to a family of curves which spread out according to z/L at low frequencies but converge to a single universal curve in the inertial subrange. The paper compares these results with data obtained by other investigators over both land and water. Spectral constants for velocity and temperature are determined and the variability in the recent estimates of the constants is discussed. The high-frequency behaviour is consistent with local isotropy. In the inertial subrange, where the spectra fall as n−5/3, the cospectra fall faster: uω and ωθ as n−7/3, and uθ, on the average, as n−5/2. The 4/3 ratio between the transverse and longitudinal spectral levels is observed at wavelengths of the order of the height above ground under unstable conditions and at wavelengths of the order of L/10 under stable conditions. This lower isotropic limit is shown to be governed by the combined effects of shear and buoyancy on small-scale eddies.},

abstract = {Abstract Analysis of measurements on atmospheric turbulence with respect to the statistics of velocity increments reveals that the statistics are not Gaussian but highly intermittent. Here, we demonstrate that the higher quantity of extreme events in atmospheric wind fields transfers to alternating loads on the airfoil and on the main shaft in the form of torque fluctuations. For this purpose, alternating loads are discussed with respect to their increment statistics. Our conjecture is that the anomalous wind statistics are responsible for load changes, which may potentially contribute to additional loads and may cause additional fatigue. Our analysis is performed on three different wind field data sets: measured fields, data generated by a standard wind field model and data generated by an alternative model based on continuous time random walks, which grasps the intermittent structure of atmospheric turbulence in a better way. Our findings suggest that fluctuations in the loads might not be reflected properly by the standard wind field models. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
